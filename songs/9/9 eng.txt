I'm just born with a humor
Why did you turn my head away from me?
Ok baby is where I am wrong to make mistakes wrong
Calm down do not get angry
Do not be angry I say a hundred times sorry
Do not marvel at anything amazing?

I said boys do not care is self-righteous
We girls once again back to give you a chance
Please do not bother you to be a bunch of silly
How to learn is not misunderstanding is atonement is you wrong

Is my trouble or the relatives of each month harm me
Why can not I be silent?
Ok baby as if I do not blame me please
To hold something do not dodge
Do not be angry I say a hundred times sorry
Do not marvel at anything amazing?

I said boys do not care is self-righteous
We girls once again back to give you a chance
Please do not bother you to be a bunch of silly
How to learn is not misunderstanding is atonement is you wrong

(Together)
Is not enough love me is not do not understand me
Is not that I did not enter your ears
I said boys do not care is self-righteous
We girls once again back to give you a chance
Please do not bother you to be a bunch of silly
How to learn not to quickly admit that they are wrong

(Xu)
I said boys do not care is self-righteous
We girls once again back to give you a chance
Please do not bother you to be a bunch of silly
How to learn is not misunderstanding is atonement is you wrong
