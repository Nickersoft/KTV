The start of love is always the most beautiful moment
Those classisc likeTitanic, Romeo and Juliet
Those dramatic, touching plots
All say love can overcome life and death
We were once so determined that once we love, we won't change

Please don't say goodbye to me. Just one goodbye
That ends everything
Can you please not say goodbye, your goodbye
Said so explicitly
Hone comoe we have to be two worlds apart? 
With no way to connect
If we part now, will we meet again? 

Our photos captured our happiness for eternity
Just that, whatever happiness was frozen in just one moment
All those super slow, tragic songs
Have said after love, it'll be leaving
Should've heeded to those warnings. Not like we're more special than most. 

Please don't say goodbye to me. Just one goodbye
Makes love superficial
Please don't say "see you again". Even so
That won't change anything. 
Even if we are two worlds apart right now
With no way to connect
No need for sorry. It is really a goodbye. 

If we're destined, then we'll meet again
Since the world is round anyway
Even if today, you have to go far away
It's just at the horizon anyway
That doesn't matter. Wishes don't always come true
And promises may not be fulfilled
And when we wake up, it will be a new day. 

Please don't say goodbye to me. Just one goodbye
Makes love superficial
Please don't say "see you again". Even so
That won't change anything. 
Even if we are two worlds apart right now
With no way to connect
No need for sorry. It is really a goodbye. 

When love is over, all we can say is goodbye.
