I travelled to the north
dont ask about my homewtown 
not even the towering old wall
could block the sadness

I travvle dto the north
is my families doing well?
carrying a bag full of gloom on my shoulders

some say he is deb-t ridder
and forced to flee
some say they couldnt find any place or oporuty to show thiir tallents
some have lost thir way in way and wandering aimlessly
some are working hard to fil their stomach and support their families
he lives in a jobs apartment
on the outskirts of Beijing
populated by foreigners
who come from all over the place
He's busy preparing his resume
with huge expectations
Back and forth on 930th avenue
while waitinf for that miracle
Don't wanna listen and tihnk about it
I dare not to turn back toward regrets
I insist to travel with my dreams
Being forced to let go all my previous prides and status
Even if I failed I will never give up or retreat

Farewell to the south
My most beautiful homeland
Illusions of my homeland together with swaying coconut tree and formed in my dream
its too fuzzy and unclear
to the point that I cant see whats ahead

I travelled to the North don't ask about my hometown 
Not even the towering old wall
could block the sadness

I travveled to teh North
Is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag full
Of gloom on my shoulders

This will be my last and final attempt
It seems impossible to return to my far hometown Oh
They dont like this place because of the bad air and messiness
they cant get used to this place because of the traffic and its rush
people gpong and viewing cynically towards earchother on the sidewalk
He gets himself drunk all the time in attempt to mix into this contaiminated society
wobblign around with a botttle of ErGuoTou in his hand
Those who are frustrated collapsed at the backlane
Chewing beef tripe with boiled button meet whiel holding a bowl of hot soup
Trying hard to relive this uncomfortable heart
Dont wanna listen and think about it 
I dare not to turn back toward regrets
I insist to travel with my dreams
Being forced to let go all my previous prides and status
Even if I failed, I will never give up or regret
Farewell to the South my most beautiful homeland 
Illusions of my hometown together with the swaying cococnut tree and formed in my dream
It's too fuzzy and unclear to the point that I can't see what's ahead

I traveled to the North
Don't ask about my hometown 
Not even the towering old wall
could vlock the sadness

I traelled to the North 
Is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag on my shoulders full of melancholy
Like the dust Im drifting togethetr with the wind
Who could bring me to fly high in sky
I stood in the Temple of Heaen and closed my eyes
Praying for the bliss of my family

I travelled to the North
Don't ask about my hometown 
Not even the towering 
could block the sadness

I travelled to the North
Is my family dling well?
Carrying a bag full of gloom on my shoulders
