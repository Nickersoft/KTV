Wandering on the road
You have to go via via
Fragile pride
That was my appearance
The uneasiness of boiling
Where are you going?
The mystery of the same silence
Are you really listening to the story?
I have crossed the mountains and the sea
Also through the sea of ​​people
I used to have everything
Blink of an eye is like smoke
I was lost and lost in all directions
Until you see the ordinary is the only answer
When you are still fantasy
Your tomorrow via via
Will she be better or worse?
It was another day for me
I have ruined everything for me
Just want to leave forever
I have fallen into the boundless darkness
Want to struggle to extricate themselves
I was like you like him like wild grass wildflowers
Despair also eager to cry also laughing ordinary
Move forward so go
Even if you were given anything
Move forward so go
Even if you were taken away
Move forward so go
Even if you will miss anything
Move forward so go
Even if you will
I have crossed the mountains and the sea
Also through the sea of ​​people
I used to have everything
Blink of an eye is like smoke
I was lost and lost in all directions
Until you see the ordinary is the only answer
I have ruined everything for me
Just want to leave forever
I have fallen into the boundless darkness
Want to struggle to extricate themselves
I was like you like him like wild grass wildflowers
Despair also eager to cry also laughing ordinary
I have crossed the mountains and the sea
Also through the sea of ​​people
I have traveled all over the world
Never got the answer
I'm just like you like him like wild grass wildflowers
Somewhere this is the only way I have to go ah
Time is so silent
Tomorrow has been in hia hia
The wind is still far away
What is your story?
